            <h2>Vehicle–Grid Interaction and Smart Grid - V2G</h2>
            <p class="author">Author: 醬AI小編</p>

            <p>
                V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid), also referred to as vehicle–grid interaction, denotes that beyond charging, an electric vehicle (EV) can return (export) the energy stored in its traction battery back to the power grid. EVs charge during off-peak intervals when prices are low and discharge during peak load or high grid-stress intervals, thereby regulating supply–demand balance and system frequency. The core is to integrate EVs, residential storage, public charging infrastructure, and renewable power plants into a cloud platform to form a dynamically controllable distributed supply network. This architecture enhances Taiwan’s grid resilience, reduces reserve/backup costs, and increases the utilization of renewable electricity. It is not only a technological innovation but also a foundational layer for the energy transition.
            </p>

     

            <h4>I. Aggregation and Coordination: Turning Distributed Assets into Dispatchable Capacity</h4>
            <p>
                A V2G system must integrate vehicles of differing brands, capacities, and locations, consolidate energy and trip data in the cloud, and algorithmically determine when to charge and when to discharge. Patent clues indicate the use of revenue tiering and prioritization to balance stability and efficiency (<span class="kbd">US12181904B2</span>), as well as server-based precise management of synchronized output from multiple power-supply devices (<span class="kbd">US20240402747A1</span>). When disasters or outages occur, mobile energy devices can be dispatched across regions in real time to support flexible restoration (<span class="kbd">US9698616B2</span>).
            </p>

            <h4>II. Bidirectional Control: From Capability to Stable and Accurate Dispatch</h4>
            <p>
                Exported power must tightly control voltage, frequency, and phase to avoid disturbing the distribution network. Relevant patents treat the EV as a controllable bidirectional storage unit capable of providing ancillary services such as frequency regulation (<span class="kbd">US20200031238A1</span>, <span class="kbd">US9630511B2</span>), and propose safety isolation and anti-backfeed mechanisms (<span class="kbd">US11374406B2</span>). Strategies also incorporate battery health and trip requirements to avoid degrading user experience.
            </p>

            <h4>III. Economic Incentives: Making Participation Easier and More Attractive</h4>
            <p>
                To motivate participation by drivers and operators, economic incentives and convenience are critical. Patents propose automated transactions, energy certificates, and revenue-sharing designs that allow participants to obtain rewards without manual operation (<span class="kbd">US11897358B2</span>, <span class="kbd">US12181904B2</span>). They also optimize jointly against price volatility and mileage needs (<span class="kbd">US8457821B2</span>), reducing range anxiety and improving participation rates.
            </p>

            <h4>IV. Mobile Resilience: Mobile Storage for Disasters and Peak Conditions</h4>
            <p>
                Unlike stationary storage, EVs are mobile and can move to where power is needed. Concepts include in-motion wireless energy return (<span class="kbd">US20240399921A1</span>) and residential peak-load shaving (<span class="kbd">US9866032B2</span>). Under disaster scenarios, EVs can serve as temporary power sources and reinforce grid restoration capability.

            <p>
                Taipower (Taiwan Power Company): The distribution side is the core stage for V2G implementation. In recent years Taipower has promoted demonstration programs, introducing bidirectional DC chargers and discharge-capable EVs to test dispatch effectiveness for peak-time feedback and off-peak charging. These efforts go beyond research; they are steps toward marketization—progressively establishing practical standards from bidirectional metering and settlement, to equipment protection and communication protocols. As the share of renewables increases, Taipower will act as the integrator and dispatcher so that every vehicle can become a stable, usable power asset.

                Nuvve × e-Formula: In 2024 the partners secured the Hsinchu V2G Hub project, planning ~325 parking bays with 95 bidirectional chargers deployed, complemented by V1G (unidirectional smart charging). A V2G + V1G hybrid configuration balances user experience with grid needs: absorbing PV during daytime and supporting reserve during night peaks, turning a parking facility into an urban storage node. The project also rehearses settlement and market participation, laying a commercial foundation for “vehicles as assets.” News: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taipower-awards-e-formula-and-nuvve-with-taiwans-first-electric-vehicle-v2g-hub-project-for-95-evs-302047795.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PR Newswire</a>, <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/us-vehicle-to-grid-specialist-nuvve-in-partnership-for-taiwans-first-bidirectional-ev-charging-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy-Storage.news</a>, <a href="https://www.microgridknowledge.com/electric-vehicles/article/33019636/nuvve-e-formula-collaborating-on-microgrid-v2g-charging-project-in-taiwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microgrid Knowledge</a>.

                Gogoro × Enel X: Two-wheeler battery swapping stations are among the densest energy nodes in Taiwan’s cities. With Enel X’s virtual power plant (VPP) integration, more than 2,500 GoStations are being transformed into dispatchable distributed resources. When system frequency support is required or PV output fluctuates sharply, stations can provide power modulation and export. This approach—“unlocking local capacity from existing dense infrastructure”—delivers dispatchability near loads without massive new hardware, upgrading the swap network from transport infrastructure to a city-scale energy asset.

                MIH Alliance (Hon Hai ecosystem) × YES Charging: The open EV platform MIH connects vehicles, cloud, and energy service providers, and in 2021 released a prototype for V2G energy integration management. The focus is not only on bidirectional chargers but also on bridging APIs, Taipower market transactions, and AI scheduling: charging/discharging profiles are preplanned based on fleet state, prices, and mobility demand, with automatic settlement. This reusable cloud architecture enables rapid replication across fleets and parking sites, shortening the path from pilot to commercialization.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                From patents to industry dynamics, V2G is progressing from concept to commercialization. Front-end hardware equips EVs with safe bidirectional charging; the mid-tier cloud handles intelligent scheduling and data analytics; and the back end establishes market-based transaction and settlement mechanisms. Taiwan has advantages in urban density, communications infrastructure, and agile inter-firm collaboration. With policy and regulatory maturation, integrating four-wheel EVs, two-wheeler swap networks, and community storage could form a new type of distributed, autonomous power substrate. In the future, every vehicle may become part of the urban grid—ready to support and supply anywhere—serving as a key actor in the energy transition.
